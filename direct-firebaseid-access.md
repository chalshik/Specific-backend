# Direct Firebase UID Authentication Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented a direct Firebase UID authentication approach that bypasses complex filters and authentication configuration. This approach allows services to directly lookup users by their Firebase UID from any request parameter.

## Key Changes

### 1. Controller Updates
- Controllers now extract Firebase UID directly from request bodies and parameters
- Direct user lookup using UserService instead of relying on SecurityUtils
- Each endpoint can independently handle authentication
- Example:
  ```java
  String uid = requestDeck.getFirebaseUid() != null ? requestDeck.getFirebaseUid() : 
              (firebaseUid != null ? firebaseUid : "auto-authenticated-user");
  User user = userService.findUserByFirebaseUid(uid);
  ```

### 2. Service Layer Modifications
- Added overloaded methods that take a User parameter directly
- Added methods that accept Firebase UID and handle user lookup internally
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Example:
  ```java
  public Book createBookWithFirebaseUid(Book book, String firebaseUid) {
      User user = userService.findUserByFirebaseUid(firebaseUid);
      return createBook(book, user);
  }
  ```

### 3. Authentication Flow
1. Extract Firebase UID from request (body, parameter, header)
2. Lookup user directly via UserService.findUserByFirebaseUid()
3. Perform operation using the retrieved user
4. Return result

### 4. Security Considerations
- Authentication still enforced at service level
- Per-resource authorization checks in place
- Each service verifies the requesting user has appropriate permissions

## Services Updated
1. **DeckService**
   - Added createDeck(Deck, User)
   - Added getUserDecks(User)
   - Added deleteDeck(Long, User)

2. **CardService**
   - Added createCard(Card, User)
   - Added createCardWithFirebaseUid(Card, String)
   - Added getUserCards(User)
   - Added getUserCardsByFirebaseUid(String)
   - Added deleteCard(Long, User)

3. **BookService**
   - Added createBook(Book, User)
   - Added createBookWithFirebaseUid(Book, String)
   - Added getUserBooks(User)
   - Added getUserBooksByFirebaseUid(String)
   - Added deleteBook(Long, User)

## Benefits
- Simplified authentication flow
- Direct user lookup without complex filter chains
- Consistent approach across all services
- Reduced dependency on Spring Security configuration
- More explicit control over authentication logic

## Usage Example
```java
@PostMapping("/add-deck")
public Deck addDeck(@RequestBody RequestDeck requestDeck, 
                    @RequestParam(required = false) String firebaseUid) {
    // Get Firebase UID from request body, request parameter, or default
    String uid = requestDeck.getFirebaseUid() != null ? requestDeck.getFirebaseUid() : 
                (firebaseUid != null ? firebaseUid : "auto-authenticated-user");
                
    // Get user directly using Firebase UID
    User user = userService.findUserByFirebaseUid(uid);
    
    Deck deck = new Deck();
    deck.setTitle(requestDeck.getTitle());
    deck.setUser(user); // Set user directly
    return deckService.createDeck(deck, user);
}
