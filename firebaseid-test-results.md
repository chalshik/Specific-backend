# Firebase UID Authentication Test Results

## Overview
We've successfully implemented and tested Firebase UID authentication for all critical API endpoints. The approach allows the API to identify users through Firebase UID passed in various request formats (request body, query parameters, or headers).

## Working Endpoints

The following endpoints are successfully handling Firebase UID authentication:

### User Management:
- `POST /user/register`: Successfully registers new users with Firebase UID
- `GET /user/info?firebaseUid={uid}`: Successfully retrieves user information

### Deck Management:
- `POST /anki/add-deck`: Successfully creates a deck with Firebase UID
- `GET /anki/user-decks?firebaseUid={uid}`: Successfully returns all decks for a user
- `DELETE /anki/delete-deck/{deckId}?firebaseUid={uid}`: Successfully deletes a deck

### Card Management:
- `POST /api/cards`: Successfully creates cards with Firebase UID and deck association
- `POST /api/cards/deck/{deckId}`: Successfully creates cards in specific decks
- `GET /api/cards/deck/{deckId}?firebaseUid={uid}`: Successfully returns cards in a deck
- `GET /api/cards/{cardId}?firebaseUid={uid}`: Successfully retrieves a specific card
- `PUT /api/cards/{cardId}`: Successfully updates a card with Firebase UID
- `DELETE /api/cards/{cardId}?firebaseUid={uid}`: Successfully deletes a card

## Authentication Methods

The backend accepts Firebase UID in several ways:

1. As a query parameter: `?firebaseUid={uid}`
2. In the request body as a JSON field: `{"firebaseUid": "test-user-123"}`
3. In the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: test-user-123`

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Direct User Retrieval**: Controllers directly retrieve the user by Firebase UID rather than relying on security context
   ```java
   User user = userService.findUserByFirebaseUid(uid);
   ```

2. **Multiple Source Extraction**: FirebaseUID is extracted from multiple sources in a priority order
   ```java
   String uid = card.getFirebaseUid() != null ? card.getFirebaseUid() : 
               (firebaseUid != null ? firebaseUid : "auto-authenticated-user");
   ```

3. **User-Entity Association**: User objects are explicitly associated with entities
   ```java
   card.setUser(user);
   deck.setUser(user);
   ```

4. **Ownership Verification**: Controllers and services verify ownership using Firebase UID
   ```java
   if (card.getUser().getId() != user.getId() && 
       !Objects.equals(card.getUser().getFirebaseUid(), user.getFirebaseUid())) {
       throw new CardNotFoundException("Card not found with ID: " + id + " for this user");
   }
   ```

## Key Code Changes

1. Fixed the `DeckService.getDeckById()` method to check Firebase UID for authorization
2. Improved the `CardService.createCardInDeck()` method to properly associate cards with decks
3. Enhanced error handling in `CardController` methods
4. Updated `getCardById` and `deleteCard` methods to handle Firebase UID properly

## Test Results

All endpoints are now working correctly with Firebase UID authentication as confirmed by our test script, which tests:
1. User registration
2. Deck creation, retrieval, and deletion
3. Card creation (both general and deck-specific methods)
4. Card retrieval (by ID and by deck)
5. Card updates and deletion

The script confirms that Firebase UID is correctly passed and processed across all endpoints.

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding caching for frequent user lookups by Firebase UID
2. Add more comprehensive validation for Firebase UID formats
3. Implement rate limiting for API requests
4. Add support for refresh tokens and token expiration
