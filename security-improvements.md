# Security Improvements for Specific Spring Application

## Summary
We've improved the application's security and authentication consistency by ensuring that the Firebase UID is properly handled in all API requests, regardless of how it's provided (request body, parameters, headers, or authorization header).

## Key Changes

### 1. FirebaseAuthFilter Updates
- Now uses a ContentCachingRequestWrapper to read the request body multiple times
- Prioritizes Firebase UID from different sources (in order):
  1. Request body (POST/PUT requests with JSON content)
  2. Request parameters
  3. X-Firebase-Uid header
  4. Authorization header (without Bearer prefix)
- Adds detailed logging for each source

### 2. SecurityUtils Improvements
- Consolidated SecurityUtils implementation in `com.Specific.Specific.utils` package
- Added `getCurrentUser()` method to retrieve the full User entity
- Added `isResourceOwner()` method for authorization checks
- Prioritizes Firebase UID from multiple sources for flexibility
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Model Updates
- Updated RequestDeck to include a firebaseUid field
- Ensures consistent Firebase UID handling across all request types

### 4. Import Path Fixes
- Updated import statements in all services and controllers:
  - GameController
  - ReviewService
  - AuthorizationService
  - GameService
  - BookService
  - CardService
  - UserController
  - DeckController (already using correct path)

## Testing
- All services now consistently use the same SecurityUtils implementation
- Firebase UID can be provided in any of the supported formats and will be correctly processed
- Authorization checks use the updated SecurityUtils methods

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated application
- Test all API endpoints with the new Firebase UID handling
- Monitor logs for any authentication or authorization issues
